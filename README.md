# Mod13Challenge Neural Networks

Description

Neural networks are powerful machine learning algorithms. The neural network can learn to make predictions based on datasets that could are large and complex for

other types of machine learning algorithms.

Using Neural networks, Deep learning, TensorFlow & Keras this Challenge will show how developing the neural network can be deployed.
